# Sensor-fusion-for-Vehicle-Localization-with-IMU-and-Magnetometer
This GitHub repository contains code files and analysis for a project on sensor fusion for vehicle localization. The project focuses on integrating data from a GNSS puck and a Vectornav VN-100 IMU to estimate heading (yaw) and forward velocity. The code includes functions for magnetometer calibration, yaw angle estimation, velocity integration, and dead reckoning using IMU data. The repository also provides plots showcasing the magnetometer data before and after calibration, as well as comparisons between different estimation methods. The code and analysis offer insights into improving localization accuracy and understanding the performance of sensor fusion algorithms for vehicle navigation.
